moving a pack checks current node's capacity, instead of target node's capacity
player hp does not get set at the start of the game
if an item was alreay used, the effect still occured (healing potion and crystal)
player has a dungeon attribute that is never set, but used 
for shortest path the first node was the starting node, which caused problems with movePack
